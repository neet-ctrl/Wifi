     * The process follows these steps:
     * 1. If the received state is IDLE, it means the call has ended. If a session was active, we stop recording and clear the session.
     * 2. If the received state is non-IDLE (RINGING or OFFHOOK), we determinate and lock the call direction (Incoming/Outgoing).
     * 3. When we receive an OFFHOOK state (phone is active) we check the phone number:
     *    - If we receive a state with a null/anonymous phone number, we delay processing by 500ms, this is the "Verification Window".
     *    - If another broadcast containing the real number arrive within 500ms, it takes priority, stops the "Verification Window" and processes immediately.
     *    - If the "Verification Window" expires without receiving a real number, we proceed with the recording using the anonymous number (null).
     *
     * **Call Waiting / Dual-Call Edge Case:**
     * If the user is already in a call and receives a second incoming call (whether accepted or ignored), we might receive
     * a RINGING followed by an OFFHOOK event (even if the user ignore the call! and the OFFHOOK event also contains the ignored phone number).
     * Because of this, we WILL ignore any follow-up OFFHOOK event to prevent editing the current call session metadata with wrong information until we receive a IDLE state.
     * This mean the recording (if started) will capture both calls in a single audio file under the metadata
     * of the initial call. I can't find any reliable way to fix this scenario with the permissions limitations android imposes on us.
