/**
 * PhoneStateReceiver is a [BroadcastReceiver] that listens for phone call state changes INTENTS.
 * It extracts the relevant extras from the intent and forwards them to [CallSessionManager], which owns the recording decision logic.
 *
 * It is registered in AndroidManifest.xml to receive [TelephonyManager.ACTION_PHONE_STATE_CHANGED]
 * broadcasts. Android delivers this broadcast whenever a call starts ringing, is answered, or ends.
 *
 * **Note on "Double Broadcast" Behavior**:
 * As stated in [TelephonyManager.ACTION_PHONE_STATE_CHANGED] KDoc, the system sends two broadcasts for a single state transition:
 * 1. The first one always happen, and it has a null phone number.
 * 2. A second broadcast is received if the app has the READ_CALL_LOG permission, but this time containing the phone number.
 *
 * **Note on Phone Number Retrieval**:
 * Currently, we "cheats" and use the deprecated [TelephonyManager.EXTRA_INCOMING_NUMBER] to get the phone number (valid in the second broadcast!). If google ever fully discontinues this extra, we will need to
 * do call log polling (meaning whe will need to wait for the call to end, then query the latest phone number from the call log). This is not ideal, prone to race conditions. The other, preferred alternative
 * would be to use Shizuku and call a hidden api to get that data, but I'm unsure now, will make an issue.
 * For every new Android releases, we must ensure they still send the EXTRA here:
 * Android 16: https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/android-16.0.0_r4:frameworks/base/services/core/java/com/android/server/TelephonyRegistry.java;l=4349-4351
 * Android 11: https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/android-11.0.0_r40:frameworks/base/services/core/java/com/android/server/TelephonyRegistry.java;l=2566-2568
