ACCU (Android Control Center) is a self-contained management suite. It uses its own privilege engine — AccuConnectionManager — to execute elevated ADB shell commands without depending on any third-party app.

ACCU vs ROOT:
• ACCU (wireless ADB): No permanent system modification. Uses the official Android ADB/Wireless Debugging API. Can be revoked at any time. Safer.
• Root: Grants full unrestricted system access. Requires a modified bootloader/system. More powerful but higher risk.

ACCU supports both — it automatically detects root and uses it if available, falling back to wireless ADB otherwise.

HOW ACCU CONNECTS:
1. Root mode: if your device is rooted, ACCU uses LibSU to run commands as root — no setup needed.
2. Wireless ADB mode (Android 11+): ACCU pairs with Android's built-in Wireless Debugging service to run commands with shell-level privileges.

SETTING UP WIRELESS ADB (Android 11+):
1. Settings → Developer Options → Wireless Debugging → Enable
2. Tap "Pair device with pairing code" → note the IP:port and code
3. Open ACCU → Settings → ACCU Center → tap "Start Pairing Discovery"
4. Enter the 6-digit code — ACCU connects automatically

After pairing, ACCU reconnects automatically on the next launch. No re-pairing needed unless you clear credentials.""",

🟡 RECOMMENDED — Safe to remove for most users. A small number of apps depend on these.
🟠 ADVANCED — Remove with caution. Some functionality may be lost.
🔴 EXPERT — Only remove if you know what you're doing. Can break core system functions.

USING PRESETS:
1. Debloat → tap Presets button
2. Select your device brand (Samsung, Xiaomi, Google, OnePlus, etc.)
3. Review the preset — apps are marked with safety levels

COMPONENT TYPES:
• Activities: UI screens. Blocking prevents the screen from launching.
• Services: Background processes. Blocking stops background work.
• Receivers: Respond to system events (boot, screen off, connectivity). Blocking stops event handling.
• Providers: Expose data to other apps. Blocking prevents data sharing.

COMMON USE CASES:
• Block the analytics/tracking service in an app: App Detail → Components → Services → find analytics service → disable
• Prevent an app from starting on boot: Receivers → find BootReceiver → disable
• Disable in-app ads activity: Activities → find ad activity → disable
• Stop an app from sharing data with others: Providers → disable

TWO BLOCKING METHODS:
1. PM Disable (via ACCU): Uses pm disable-user. Works without root. May not work on all Samsung/MIUI devices.

HOW IT WORKS:
RootlessJamesDSP uses Android's AudioEffect API at the global session (session ID 0), which affects all audio output. Some manufacturers restrict this — if effects don't work, try root mode.

QUICK SETUP:
1. Audio Center → toggle DSP On
2. Select an EQ preset or use AutoEQ to find your headphone's profile
3. Adjust bass boost if needed
4. Enable any other effects (reverb, virtualizer)

AUTOEQ PROFILES:
AutoEQ is a database of thousands of headphone measurement-based correction profiles. These flatten the frequency response of your headphones to neutral (Harman target).
• Search by headphone model name
• Download and apply in one tap
• Significantly improves audio accuracy on most headphones

CONVOLVER (Advanced):
Load .wav impulse response files to simulate headphone speakers, or famous speaker systems.
• Great for making headphones sound like speakers
• Free IR files available from various audio communities

2. Call Recorder → grant microphone permission

HOW SCRCPY RECORDING WORKS:
The app bundles the scrcpy server binary. When a call starts, ACCU launches the scrcpy server which can capture the device's audio output stream (including the earpiece/speaker audio). This is combined with microphone input to produce a stereo recording: left=microphone, right=device output.
